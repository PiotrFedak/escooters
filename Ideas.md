# Escooters

### Ideas for future development of app:
* <strong>Price</strong> in particular, the ability to sort by the lowest price.
* <strong>built-in route planning system</strong>, help users find routes and plan trips, making it possible to get around on a escooter.
* <strong>Ride history</strong> the user can check the history of their rides on the escooter, including distance traveled and riding time.
* <strong>Personalization</strong> the user can adjust site appearance, for example dark mode.
* <strong>Sorting</strong> as I wrote sorting by lowest price but also by user rating.
* <strong>User reviews and ratings </strong> can leave reviews, comments and ratings for various Escooter.
* <strong>Loyalty program </strong> users can receive rewards and benefits for regular use of escooters as part of the loyalty program for example discounts.
* <strong>Charging Station Map</strong> include a charging station map to easily find charging stations in your area.
* <strong>User Profile </strong> The App may allow users to create a profile.
* <strong>reporting system</strong> users can report technical issues with the escooters map.
* <strong>Website available in multiple languages</strong> users can switch to different languages.
